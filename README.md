# Mission-to-Mars
This project used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
Functions created to extract title and image paths and to create a data dictionary holding the facts. Then html index file got updated to accomodate the data dictionary into the file to create responsive web site.
